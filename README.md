# Paint

In this repository, there is my Paint-reproduction project. In this application, you can draw many things, save your images with the name that you give them and many other details that I have implemented in the code.

This is not a copy of Paint, but I tried to add my touch with another type of organizations and only the most important function in Paint.

I wanted to see what I could do with my begginer's ability and I had this idea to learn new things and new ways to think like a developper.

This is not a profesionnal job but only the minimum to recreate a famous application.
